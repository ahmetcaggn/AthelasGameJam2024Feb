# Dead Colors

## About the Game
**Dead Colors** is a platformer game developed by the Athelas Studio team, created during a game jam organized by the OTG community at Sakarya University, under the theme *"Colors of Nature."* The game takes players on a journey through natureâ€™s color spectrum, with each level transitioning from muted, lifeless tones to vibrant, energetic hues as players advance.
